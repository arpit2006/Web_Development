        <h2>Cascade Algorithm</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>It decides which property will be applied or not</li>
            <li>CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets.</li>
            <li>The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.</li>
            <li>It's the reason that the text of the button styled with the above CSS will be purple.</li>
            <li>Understanding the cascade algorithm helps you understand how the browser resolves conflicts like this.
            <li>The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.</li>
            <li>Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear</li>
            <li>Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match</li>
            <li>Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style,</li>
            <li>CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS</li>
            <li>Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type</li>
        </ol>
